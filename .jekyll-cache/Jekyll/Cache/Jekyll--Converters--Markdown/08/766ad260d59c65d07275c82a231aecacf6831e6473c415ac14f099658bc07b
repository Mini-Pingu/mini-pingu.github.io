I":<p>Hi, there. I have spent around two days In researching and conducting the strategy of writing and speaking sections in IELTS. As for writing section, mostly I read the textbook borrowed from my colleague who took the exam a few years ago. Suggestions from that textbook are impressively clear and practical. I will summarize in the rest of this post.</p>

<p>As for another section, speaking, I would recommend E2 IELTS channel on YouTube. When being bored from content from that textbook, I would love to change myself into a visualized approach of learning. The conversation between Jay and Alex about illustrating how to handle the interaction in speaking section minute by minute is really attracting. I may conclude the advises I absorb in the future post. Anyway, letâ€™s beginning my notes in writing first.</p>

<h1><strong> 1. General Tips </strong></h1>
<p>Despite the objectives of two major tasks in writing section are quite different, there are still four common prespectives we should pay more attentions into:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Task Response</li>
  <li>Conherence and Cohesion</li>
  <li>Lexical Resource</li>
  <li>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</li>
</ol>

<p>I notice that my weakness are mostly located on the second and third points, which means this is essential for myself focusing on the relationship between each sentence and paragraph, as well as expressing myself precisely with accurated vocabulary. I am confort with understanding what</p>
