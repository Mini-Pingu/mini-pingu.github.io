I"Ô<p>I have been researching the concept of user interface and user experiences for almost two weeks. In part 1, I will talk about why I want to learn figma, and the common parts between figma and react. In the later part 2 post, I will show you what methods I adept, and some pratical tips for you when designing website pages by figma.</p>

<p>Honestly, comparing with the UI/UX, the backend development seems easier for me. I can careless about what usersâ€™ feeling, but force on the functional outcome they want. However, that is exact reason why I want to know UI/UX sooner. You may ask: why not leave these troubles to designer? Well, without understanding usersâ€™ behavior and emotional state, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes <strong><em>A LOTS</em></strong>, not matter from designer or project manager. I hate being overwhiled with who acting weaknesses with clients, and cannot direct clientsâ€™ feeling in negotiation phase. Sometimes, their requirements are not the real ones. Given the knowledge of UI/UX, I am capable to communicate with my clients, find out their expectation, give feedback about which features are realistic but which are not immediately.</p>
