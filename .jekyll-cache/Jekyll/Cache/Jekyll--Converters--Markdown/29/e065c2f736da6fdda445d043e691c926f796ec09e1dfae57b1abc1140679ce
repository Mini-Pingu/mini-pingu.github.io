I"…<p>According to the plan, I will take IELTS examination in December. This topic is a good idea as the beginning post of this blog, I assume. The reason for applying IELTS exam is I will enroll a computer science master degree next year. The minimized requirement is average band 6, single section is not allowed lower than band 5.5.</p>

<p>I am going to spend whole day for studying</p>
