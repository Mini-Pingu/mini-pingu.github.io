I"j<p>I think tonight is the best time for foreseeing plan , during the serious pandemic outbreak and hurricane outside.</p>

<p>I have been researching user interface and user experience technology for almost two weeks. With the MERN experiences previously, it will be easier to design the logical layer, comparing with the UI/UX design one. That is the reason why I want to know UI/UX. Without understanding correctly about user behaviors, I have to refactor the backend logical functions so many times when requirements changes</p>

<p>I have an immature idea about the first application build by myself named <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>. This website is some kind of dispatching tasks application, but I attach some interesting features on it, based on the the job I finish in current company.</p>

<p>Alongside with developing this <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>, this is also important to convince my bosses that the value of this website is closely bounding with companyâ€™s. :)</p>

<p>Here is something I want to master for the next 8 months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cyber security</li>
  <li>Database design (including DBSM and SQL)</li>
  <li>Project management</li>
  <li>The principles of Node.js</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these is as preparation for the master degree in next year. That will be not enough real world engineer experiences for me.</p>
