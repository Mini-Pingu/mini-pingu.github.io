I"f<p>Hi, there. I have spent around two days In researching and conducting the strategy of writing and speaking sections in IELTS. As for writing section, mostly I read the textbook borrowed from my colleague who took the exam a few years ago. Suggestions from that textbook are impressively clear and practical. I will summarize in the rest of this post.</p>
