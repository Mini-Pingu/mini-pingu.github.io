I"Ø<p>Hi, there. I have spent around two days In researching and conducting the strategy of writing and speaking sections in IELTS. As for writing section, mostly I read the textbook borrowed from my colleague who took the exam a few years ago. Suggestions from that textbook are impressively clear and practical. I will summarize in the rest of this post.</p>

<p>As for another section, speaking, I would recommend E2 IELTS channel on YouTube. When being bored from content from that textbook, I would love to change myself into a visualized approach of learning. The conversation between Jay and Alex about illustrating how to handle the interaction in speaking section minute by minute is really attracting. I may conclude the advises I absorb in the future post. Anyway, letâ€™s beginning my notes in writing first.</p>
