I"Ì<p>According to the plan, I will take IELTS examination in December. This topic is a good idea as the really beginning post for this blog, I assume.</p>

<p>The reason for applying IELTS exam is that I will enroll into a computer science master degree next year. The minimized requirement is average band 6, each section is not allowed lower than band 5.5. It seems not that hard, right? But I still cannot underestimated that because this maybe the one and only chance I got.</p>

<p>I am going to spend a whole day for studying how to get higher scores in writing section. I learn the strategy for speaking section yesterday. The material I referred is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/E2IELTS">E2 IELTS</a></p>
