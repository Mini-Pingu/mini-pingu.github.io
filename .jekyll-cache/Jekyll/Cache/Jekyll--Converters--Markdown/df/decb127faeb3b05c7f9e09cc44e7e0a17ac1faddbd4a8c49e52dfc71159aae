I"ù<p>I have been researching the concept of user interface and user experiences for almost two weeks. Honestly, comparing with the UI/UX design one, the backend development</p>

<p>The reason why I want to learn UI and UX. Without understanding correctly about user behaviors, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes <strong><em>A LOTS</em></strong>. I hate this. This has to be under my control.</p>

<p>I have an immature idea about a website named <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>. This is kind of tasks dispatcher, but I attach some interesting and pratical features to it, based on the the job I finish in current company.</p>

<p>Alongside with developing <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>, this is also important to convince my bosses that the value of this website is closely bounded with the companyâ€™s. :)</p>

<p>Here is something I want to master for the next 8 months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cyber security</li>
  <li>Database design (including DBSM and SQL)</li>
  <li>Project management</li>
  <li>The principles of Node.js</li>
  <li>Javascript<br /><br /></li>
</ol>

<p>All of these as preparation for the master degree in next year. That will be no enough real world engineering experiences for me.</p>
