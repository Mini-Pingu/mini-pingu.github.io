I"…<p>I have been researching the concept of user interface and user experiences for almost two weeks. Honestly, comparing with the UI/UX, the backend development seems easier for me. I can careless about what usersâ€™ feeling, but force on the functional outcome they want more. In part 1, I will talk about why I want to learn figma, and the common parts between figma and react.</p>

<p>The reason why I want to know UI/UX. You may ask: why not leaves these jobs to designer? Well, without understanding usersâ€™ behavior and emotional state directly, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes <strong><em>A LOTS</em></strong>, not matter from designer or project manager. I hate being overwhiled with who acting weaknesses in front of clients, and cannot direct clientsâ€™ feeling in negotiation. Sometimes, their necessary is not the real ones.</p>
