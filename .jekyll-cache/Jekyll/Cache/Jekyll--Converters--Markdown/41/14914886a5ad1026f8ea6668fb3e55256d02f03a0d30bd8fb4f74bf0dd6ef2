&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hi, there. I have spent around two days In researching and conducting the strategy of writing and speaking sections in IELTS. As for writing section, mostly I read the textbook borrowed from my colleague who took the exam a few years ago. Suggestions from that textbook are impressively clear and practical. I will summarize in the rest of this post.

As for another section, speaking, I would recommend E2 IELTS channel on YouTube. When being bored from content from that textbook, I would love to change myself into a visualized approach of learning. The conversation between Jay and Alex about illustrating how to handle the interaction in speaking section minute by minute is really attracting. I may conclude the advises I absorb in the future post. Anyway, let's beginning my notes in writing first.

<h1><strong> 1. General Tips </strong></h1>
Despite the objectives of two major tasks in writing section are quite different, there are still four common prespectives we should pay more attentions into:

1. Task Response
2. Conherence and Cohesion
3. Lexical Resource
4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy<br /><br />

I notice that my weakness are mostly located on the second and third points, which means this is essential for myself focusing on how to enhance the relationship between each sentence and paragraph, as well as expressing myself precisely with more accurated vocabulary. I am confort with understanding what the main idea examiner expects me to write down, and I can train wrting ability in order to save more time to correct my grammatical mistakes during the exam. I should find a handy chrome extension to record the words and pharses in working hours, and [thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/synonym){:target="\_blank"} is a really suitable website for this.

<h1><strong> 2. Eassy Structure Analysis </strong></h1>
After read thought around fourty essays about task 2 in textbook, I find out some comman patterns among them.

Generally, there are three parts you are capable to finish within fourty minutes. Introduction, explanatory paragraphs, and conclusion.

<strong> Introduction </strong>

You should not waste too much time in recalling which angle or ideas is perfect to approache for real exam. Beacuse you are expected well-prepared for topics choosing before. After choosing the main idea, you have to immediately chunk down the introduction into four sentences:

1. Summarize the question you have been asked with synonyms words.
2. Expand that with more facts or your opinions deeper.
3. Introduce your idea with a short and cleaer main sentence.
4. Illustrate how many prespectives and paragraphs you want to explain later.<br /><br />

<strong> Explanatory paragraphs </strong>

Bearing with the main concept, it will be easy to expand into two or three paragraphs with your own interesting perspectives, just be careful about the second and third points in General Tips. That will be fine, I assure you. I will appand with more posts later about the strategy in this part also.

<strong> Conclusion </strong>

The last but not least, conclusion is mostly recapitulating your main sentence, and summarizing the main points of previous paragraphs in one or two sentences only.

What I am talking above is targeting on task 2 only, the dificulty of task 1 is far easier than task 2. It is okay to copy this method in task 1. Of course, I will update what I learn before I take the excam in December. :)
