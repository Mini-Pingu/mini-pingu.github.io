I"'<p>I have been researching user interface and user experience technology for almost two weeks. With the MERN experiences previously, it will be easier to design the logical layer, comparing with the UI/UX design one.</p>

<p>The reason why I want to know UI/UX more. Without understanding correctly about user behaviors, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes <strong><em>A LOTS</em></strong>. I hate this. This has to be under my control.</p>

<p>I have an immature idea about a website named <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>. This is kind of tasks dispatcher, but I attach some interesting and pratical features to it, based on the the job I finish in current company.</p>

<p>Alongside with developing <strong><em>Hephaestus</em></strong>, this is also important to convince my bosses that the value of this website is closely bounded with the companyâ€™s. :)</p>

<p>Here is something I want to master for the next 8 months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cyber security</li>
  <li>Database design (including DBSM and SQL)</li>
  <li>Project management</li>
  <li>The principles of Node.js</li>
  <li>Javascript<br /><br /></li>
</ol>

<p>All of these as preparation for the master degree in next year. That will be no enough real world engineering experiences for me.</p>
