I have been researching the concept of user interface and user experiences for almost two weeks. In part 1, I will talk about why I want to learn figma. In the later part 2 post, I will show you what methods I adept, and some pratical tips for you when designing website pages by figma.

Honestly, comparing with the UI/UX, the backend development seems easier for me. I can careless about what users' feeling, but force on the functional outcome they want. However, that is exact reason why I want to know UI/UX sooner. You may ask: why not leave these troubles to designer? Well, without understanding users' behavior and emotional state, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes **_A LOTS_**, not matter from designer or project manager.

I hate being overwhiled with who acting weaknesses with clients, and cannot direct clients' feeling in the negotiation phase. Sometimes, their requirements are not the real ones. Given the knowledge of UI/UX, I am capable to communicate with my clients, find out their expectation, give feedback about which features are realistic, but which are not immediately.
