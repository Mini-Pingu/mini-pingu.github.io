<p>I have been researching the concept of user interface and user experiences for almost two weeks. In part 1, I will talk about why I want to learn figma, and the common parts between figma and react.</p>

<p>Honestly, comparing with the UI/UX, the backend development seems easier for me. I can careless about what users’ feeling, but force on the functional outcome they want. However, that is exact reason why I want to know UI/UX. You may ask: why not leaves these jobs to designer? Well, without understanding users’ behavior and emotional state directly, I have to refactor the logical functions in backend so many times when requirements changes <strong><em>A LOTS</em></strong>, not matter from designer or project manager. I hate being overwhiled with who acting weaknesses in front of clients, and cannot direct clients’ feeling in negotiation. Sometimes, their necessary is not the real ones. Given the knowledge of UI/UX, I am capable to communicate with my clients, find out their expectation of this website,</p>
