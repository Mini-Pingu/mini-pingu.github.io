I"<p>According to the plan, I will take IELTS examination in December. This topic is a good idea as the really beginning post for this blog, I assume.</p>

<p>The reason for applying IELTS exam is that I will enroll into a computer science master degree next year. The minimized requirement is average band 6, each section is not allowed lower than band 5.5. It seems not that hard, right? But I still cannot underestimated that as this maybe the only chance I got.</p>

<p>I am going to spend whole day for studying</p>
